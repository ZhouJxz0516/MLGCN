# MLGCN
MLGCN are based on the multi-layers Graph Convolutional Network to identify cancer driver genes
Run the MLCGN should under the environment of python =3.8 , pytorch =2.1.2 and pytorch geometric =1.7.0

You can change the parameters and dataset according to your own needs. We run it in pycharm, right-click on the MLGCN file to run the code

The final result return a list of predicted value of each unlabeled gene.
